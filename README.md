This project gave me an incredible amount of trouble. Though I tried very hard to follow the Screencast, I kept running into issues with my code. Even in terms of the link I'm turning in, I'm still not sure if this contains all my changes because my files themselves got mixed up in the cloning process. I succeeded in creating a moving, player-controlled rocket. Bullets do fire, though not from the ship itself. There is a meteor, and it will change the health of the player when they collide. However, health is only displayed following a collision and not by default. I'm not exactly sure where I went wrong with this project but it definitely does not meet all of the requirements of the assignment. I am ready to move on and try and create a more successful product in the future.
